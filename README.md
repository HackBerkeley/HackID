HackID
======

Authentication solution for the Hackers@Berkeley community
----------------------------------------------------------

Usage
-----
- Works a lot like the facebook graph API
- `http://localhost/me?access_token=...` returns `{ "name" : "insert name here" }` and that's about it right now.
- More extensive documentation coming after all security holes are patched and the code is cleaner.
- Currently there isn't a good way to request a developer `client_id` and `client_secret`, but that will be coming soon as well.
- Still figuring out what you have to do to get a HackID.
